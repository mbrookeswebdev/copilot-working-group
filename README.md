# Copilot Working Group Workshops

## Workshops and Exercises

### Workshop 1: GitHub Copilot

- Exercise 1: Create a missing test for `<ProductDetail />`
  - Prompt Copilot to add a test that covers `<ProductDetail />`.
  - Run and refine the test based on observed behavior.
  - Iterate with Copilot Chat to improve assertions and coverage.
  - [Chat in GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/chat-with-copilot/chat-in-github)

- Exercise 2: Add Copilot Instructions
  - Create repo instructions to guide code and test generation.
  - Specify preferred conventions and constraints relevant to this project.
  - Re-run prompts from Exercise 1 to compare improved output.
  - [Add repository instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/configure-custom-instructions/add-repository-instructions)

- Exercise 3: Participant's choice feature
  - Implement a small feature (e.g., add cart persistence for items added to the cart across sessions).
  - Add or adjust tests and instructions as needed.
  - Open a PR and use @copilot to propose additional tests, summarize changes, and suggest refactors.

### Workshop 2: VSCode Copilot

- WIP

### Workshop 3: Custom Agents

- WIP

## Goals

- Practice effective prompting in both chat and PR environments.
- Use instructions to guide Copilot's output for consistency and quality.
- Build confidence integrating Copilot into everyday workflows across GitHub, VSCode, and custom agents.
